This program runs almost entirely off of input from the user.  It learns as it goes, with the help of standard input from the user through the keyboard to insert questions and answers.  It will successfully save a completed game should the user wish, however, loading a game was not completed without hiccups.  The code in main.cpp will load a game and get the tree working.  I couldn't get it to run smoothly with that incorporated, and therefore left it out.  I could have improved it further by creating a saveGame function and probably at least one other to consolidate the code.

**This program is completed under the testNode.cpp file, *NOT main.cpp.
